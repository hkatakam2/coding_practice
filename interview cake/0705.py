find a duplicate, space edition beast mode

1. the integers are in the range 1..n
2. the list has a length of n+1

the list has atleast 1 duplicate. find a duplicate number without 
modifying the input and optimizing for space.

O(n) time and O(1) space


Alright, we've pieced together an entire strategy to find a duplicate integer! Working backward:
A. We know the position of a node with multiple incoming pointers 
is a duplicate in our list because the nodes that pointed to it must have the same value.
B. We find a node with multiple incoming pointers by finding the first 
node in a cycle.
C. We find the first node in a cycle by finding the length of the cycle
and advancing two pointers: one starting at the head of the linked list, 
and the other starting ahead as many steps as there are steps in the cycle. The pointers will meet at the first node in the cycle.
D. We find the length of a cycle by remembering a position inside the 
cycle and counting the number of steps it takes to get back to that position.
E. We get inside a cycle by starting at the head and walking n steps.
We know the head of the list is at position n + 1.
